                    The mission was directed to disrupt the current workflow in the restaurant industry by providing intuitive tools for simple and accurate financial management. 
                    In a very interactive environment, I took part in the software design implementation for a new product that is used to automate and simplify the processes of invoice analysis in restaurants, thereby greatly bettering the business views for proprietors and managers at large. 
                    In this regard, my role was central in driving features easy to use, reliability, and driving the culture of continuous improvement and innovation.
